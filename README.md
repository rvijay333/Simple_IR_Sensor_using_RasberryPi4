# Simple_IR_Sensor_using_RasberryPi4

### MY FIRST PROJECT USING RASBERRY PI .
### A SIMPLE IR SENSOR (WITH A LED AND A BUZZER )!

### This repository contains a Python script designed for the Raspberry Pi 4 that uses an infrared (IR) sensor to detect obstacles. When an obstacle is detected, the system activates an LED and a buzzer, making it suitable for robotics, security systems, and other interactive projects.

### Features:
#### Obstacle Detection: Utilizes an IR sensor to monitor for obstacles.
#### Visual and Audible Alerts: Activates an LED and a buzzer when an obstacle is detected.
#### Easy to Deploy: Simple setup and straightforward code for quick integration with Raspberry Pi projects.

### Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 (or any compatible model)
- IR Sensor (connected to GPIO pin 26)
- LED (connected to GPIO pin 17)
- Buzzer (connected to GPIO pin 24)
- Connecting wires

 
## Software Requirements

- Python 3
- [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/) library


## Real Time Applications

- **Security Systems:**  
  Integrate the obstacle detection system into security setups to trigger alarms when unauthorized movement is detected, especially in low-light or unattended areas.

- **Robotics Navigation:**  
  Use the sensor as a part of an autonomous navigation system in robots, ensuring that the robot avoids obstacles and safely maneuvers through its environment.

- **Smart Home Automation:**  
  Incorporate the sensor into home automation projects to control lighting, alarms, or notifications when movement is detected in specific areas.

- **Industrial Safety:**  
  Implement the system in manufacturing or warehouse settings to monitor for obstacles or people near dangerous machinery, enhancing workplace safety.

- **Automotive Proximity Warning:**  
  Adapt the sensor for use in vehicle systems to provide basic proximity warnings, helping to avoid collisions in low-speed environments.
